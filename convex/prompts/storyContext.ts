Dont force the usage of the information from here, otherwise every generation will use the same things and it will get buring, but keep it in mind and try to imagine what other things the characters could be interested in, how would they think, what would they do and say.



## The Conceptual Jungle: Initial Research Reports

The designers involved in the residency—Marcin, Agnieszka, Janek, Paulina, and Paweł—have been intensely mapping out conceptual directions, diving deep into inspirations ranging from animal architecture and material science to digital processes and abstract sensory input,. Their initial thoughts prioritize using Artificial Intelligence (AI) not merely as a tool for generating pretty images, but as a collaborative partner or "agent" capable of accelerating experiments, optimizing complex processes, and challenging human creative limitations,. The core goal remains the integration of AI, craft, and design, drawing inspiration heavily from nature and its inherent principles of geometry, adaptation, and collective intelligence,,.

### Marcin Ebert: The Algorithm Alchemist

Marcin’s initial research is driven by the desire to leverage the technological singularity represented by AI, viewing it as a historic opportunity to push beyond human creative constraints. He is deeply interested in using AI to optimize processes and generate **impossible geometries** that humans cannot easily conceive, such as structures achieving maximum strength with minimal material. His approach involves testing adaptive robotics and complex procedural loops: scanning natural items, rough CNC milling, introducing randomness (like sandblasting), rescanning the resulting irregularities, and then refining the form with AI-driven carving, simulating the subtractive work of natural agents like beavers or bark beetles (korniki),,. He specifically plans to use advanced tools like ComfyUI to **collide disparate aesthetics**, such as combining the ephemeral quality of sea foam with materials like milled stainless steel, aiming for surprising, non-traditional design outcomes.

Marcin is also exploring the fundamental *needs* driving creation, contrasting human needs (like self-realization) with the needs of nature or matter itself,. Technologically, he focuses on how to reduce the designer's role to a curator or interpreter, allowing the AI technology itself to have "expression," perhaps by training models on specific aesthetic tastes to produce cohesive collections, or by employing sophisticated multi-agent systems where AI agents (like a philosopher and a mathematician) collaborate on the design,,. Furthermore, he has looked into AI applications addressing social needs, such as creating objects that facilitate communication between people with different personality types (e.g., ADHD) by predicting emotional states or necessary relational contexts,,.

### Agnieszka Wach: The Symbiotic Surveyor

Agnieszka is inspired by concepts of **dispersed intelligence** and **non-human cognition**, referencing organisms like octopuses that map space through touch, and collective intelligence systems like slime molds optimizing pathways,,. Her primary research thread explores **hyperaccumulation**, specifically plants (metalophytes) that absorb heavy metals from polluted soil, viewing this process as a powerful metaphor for an object that "accumulates" data from its environment,,. This concept feeds into her goal of creating an object derived entirely from environmental data collected in Sobole, perhaps using bio-indicators like lichens to gauge air quality.

Her key conceptual framework involves defining the **agency** in the design process, proposing a system where the Environment, Human, Algorithm, and Machine each possess a "right of decision," introducing controlled randomness,. Agnieszka is keen on translating abstract environmental phenomena, particularly **waves** (light or sound) and their associated qualities, into physical, spatial forms,. She suggests using AI to generate code for complex geometries based on natural growth patterns (L-systems, differential growth, Voronoi algorithms) and mixing these digital outputs with traditional craft techniques to achieve a hybrid material outcome,,.

### Janek Wilczak: The Geometric Naturalist

Janek's initial research is firmly anchored in exploring the **mathematics and geometry inherent in nature**,. He is fascinated by the principles of animal architecture, studying examples from fish schools and bird flocks to the highly optimized, metropolitan structures of ant and termite colonies,. He highlights the efficiency found in organisms without central brains, such as the slime mold that solved the Tokyo metro map optimization problem faster than human mathematicians—a powerful analogy for AI algorithms.

His current focus involves transitioning from mere 2D image generation to true **3D processing and algorithmic design**. Janek is experimenting with visual programming tools like Geometry Nodes in Blender and having AI (specifically large language models) write Python code to define complex spatial transformations,. His main idea is to use AI to generate programs based on pure mathematical or geometric patterns derived from nature (e.g., ant tunnel paths, fractals), rather than feeding it visual reference images. He sees himself providing a "base" object or concept, which the AI then radically processes using biologically inspired algorithms, suggesting a form of co-creation,.

### Paulina Mucha: The Material Translator

Paulina’s research began by anchoring her concepts in the **local environment of Sobole**, focusing particularly on the challenges and visual qualities of water and the Bystrzyca River,. She is interested in the theme of **adaptability** and the intersection of nature and human culture, noticing how urban elements mimic nature or how materials degrade (e.g., pavement behaving like a sponge during floods),. Drawing on her background in ceramics and materiality, she is interested in conscious material composition and using waste (like crushed eggshells or ceramic waste) as resources for glazes or new materials,,.

Crucially, Paulina is exploring **sensory translation**—specifically, how auditory information (like sound or vibration) can be translated into tactile or spatial form,,. This focus stems partly from her personal experience as a person who is hard of hearing and uses hearing aids equipped with basic AI to enhance speech,. She sees potential for AI to assist in the highly technical and burdensome early stages of the design process, such as calculating the complex divisions and angles required for multi-part plaster molds (forma sztuczkowa) needed for ceramic casting,. Ultimately, she seeks to find a valuable way to unite the seemingly opposite poles of nature/craft and technology/AI, making the AI capable of "thinking" in an abstract, interpretive, and spatial manner, moving beyond simple 2D generative output,.

### Paweł Jasiewicz: The Mind Mapper

Paweł’s research centers on the concept of **memory, trace, and illusion**, often drawing a sharp contrast between the urban environment (which he identifies as his natural habitat) and the untamed natural world,. He observed how atmospheric phenomena, like fog, can instantly transform the perceived reality of a cityscape, blurring the line between the real and the illusory—a metaphor for the current age of AI and digital manipulation,. He views humanity as akin to **ants** or elements within a vast, interconnected mycelial system (grzybnia).

Paweł’s core idea for the project is to treat the collective thought process itself as the raw material. He proposed setting up a digital and audio journal (the "cloud") to capture their spontaneous ideas, thoughts, and conversations, which would then be **processed by the AI**,. His interest lies in how AI can analyze these human thought patterns and transform them into unexpected forms or processes, leading to outcomes that bypass traditional, pre-conceived design thinking,,. He emphasizes that the value of the project lies in the curious act of creation and development, regardless of immediate functional "need".

***

This intensive initial exploration, spanning highly specialized areas like geometric algorithms and bio-indicators, is setting the stage for the residency’s core task: defining a **new method of collaboration** where AI is not just a rendering tool, but an integral part of the creative dialogue, capable of processing complex, heterogeneous inputs (like geometry, sound, and abstract thought) into tangible physical outcomes,. This collaboration, which some suggest might be represented by a team of AI "agents" (a philosopher, a mathematician, a cook, an explorer) working together, is intended to surprise the human creators themselves,.

*Analogy:* Their initial research phase is like a group of specialized explorers descending into a dense, unknown territory. Instead of bringing back finished maps, each returns with fragments: one has geological samples (Janek's geometry), one has recorded atmospheric data (Agnieszka's sensors), one has studied the local wildlife's tools (Marcin's CNC modeling), one has collected local raw materials (Paulina's ceramics), and one has brought back subjective, mental sketches of the journey (Paweł's thought journals). The AI is the cartographer tasked with stitching these radically different, high-density data sets into a coherent, surprising new map.
